Just uploaded the latest changes, the biggest changes of all being behind-the-scenes.  There will be a large content update coming soon and I won't spoil it, but some of you might be able to pick up on what's coming once the game starts.  That's all I'll say ;)

Version 1.2 (11/11/2017)
- many internal changes to prepare for an upcoming content update
- added: number of alive tributes is shown with each status comment, and in the post text for day-to-night and night-to-day transitions
- added: on each status comment, the most aggressive tributes (those with the most kills) are shown, if any
- added: on the status comment on the winner announcement post, a ranking of tributes by kill counts is shown
- added: starting on day 4, chance of selecting a fatal event increases by 5% for each day that passes (due to a test session that made it down to Richard Nixon and Kanye West helping and cuddling with each other for two straight days)
- changed: adjusted fatality chance values by +1% each (day, night, and bloodbath; now 18, 20, and 22 respectively)
- fixed: when game ends with no survivors, the relevant ending message was not shown
- fixed: the event "(Player1) attempts to climb a tree, but falls on (Player2), killing them both." now credits Player1 with a kill
